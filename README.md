GitHubRating
============

Whether you're hiring an actual developer or just someone who needs to know how to code to solve problems, it's useful to get a feel for how much coding they actually do.

This tool runs from the command line and takes a single parameter: the github username of the person you're looking into.

The result is a composite score for their programming quality on GitHub. It's not their number of repos, or their followers, or their number of code pushes&mdash;it's all of those things combined and weighted.

Just put in the username and get out a single rating.

## Usage

Example:

<code>Usage: ./GitHubRating danielmiessler</code>

Example Output:

<code>danielmiessler has:

131 followers.
32 repositories.
352 code pushes.

Github score is: 1287
</code>
